# Machine Learning Project
Developing a model that recommends a mobile plan most tailored to user's needs.

__Description:__ \
A mobile carrier has found out that many of their subscribers use legacy plans. \
The company wants to develop a model that would analyze subscribers' behavior and recommend one of their newer plans: Smart or Ultra.

__Goal of the project:__ create a model that selects the right mobile plan with the accuracy exceeding 75%.

__ML task type:__ supervised learning.

__Type of supervised learning:__ binary classification task.

__Learning algorithms used for training:__
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* Logistic Regression

__Hyperparameters used for quality improvement:__
* Decision Tree: max_depth
* Random Forest: n_estimators
* Logistic Regression: solver

__Metrics used for model evaluation:__
* confusion matrix
* recall
* precision
* F1 score

__Results:__
* Trained 3 classification models.
* Investigated their quality with a validation set.
* Improved models' quality by tuning hyperparameters.
* Examined models' quality with a testing data set.
* Evaluated models' performance with metrics.
* Chose the best model for this classification task.
